# My courses in PDF


Here is a list of the courses I have read and that I am sharing here in PDF format

- [Deep Learning in Computer Vision](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~kosta/Courses/EECS6322/)  
  * Computer Vision is broadly defined as the study of recovering useful properties of the world from one or more images.  In recent years, Deep Learning has e  This course will cover a range of foundational topics at the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
    
- [CS231A: Computer Vision, From 3D Perception to 3D Reconstruction and beyond](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/course_notes.html)
  * An introduction to concepts and applications in computer vision primarily dealing with geometry and 3D understanding. Topics include: cameras and projection models, low-level image processing methods such as filtering and edge detection; mid-level vision topics such as segmentation and clustering; shape reconstruction from stereo; high-level vision topics such as learned object recognition, scene recognition, face detection and human motion categorization; depth estimation and optical/scene flow; 6D pose estimation and object tracking. Prerequisites: linear algebra, basic probability and statistics.
